<b>Context Managers</b>
--Use to allocate and release resources precisely
<br>
The most widely used context manager is <b>with</b>

Every context manager must have at least __enter__ and __exit__ methods defined.

It calls the <code><b>__enter__</b></code> method of File class.</br>
<code><b>__enter__</b></code> method opens the file and returns it.</br>
the opened file handle is passed to opened_file.</br>
we write to the file using .write()</br>
with statement calls the stored __exit__ method.</br>
the __exit__ method closes the file.
